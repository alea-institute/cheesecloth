Type stubs for the Cheesecloth library.

This file provides type annotations for IDE completion and type checking
while maintaining the high-performance Rust implementation.

The stubs are organized into sections corresponding to the module structure:
- Character metrics and classification
- Unicode category analysis
- Text segmentation
- Unigram (word) tokenization and analysis
- Token metrics for ML tokenizers
- Advanced metrics (compression, Zipf's law)
- Data processing utilities

For detailed documentation on each function and parameter,
refer to the actual implementation in Rust with PyO3 bindings.
